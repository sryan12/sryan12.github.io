        <p>Criminal justice is an issue which every country struggles to address. The system utilized in the United 
            States has resulted in some of the highest incarceration rates in the world. This system, often referred 
            to as mass incarceration, describes the substantial increase in the number of people imprisoned as a result 
            of punitive criminal justice policies that disproportionately impact marginalized communities. This 
            narrative draws on data from the Department of Justice’s <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/list?series_filter=Prisoners">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, and the 
            <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/">Prison Policy Institute</a> to show racial and state-level comparisons to illustrate the scale of this crisis.</p>
        <p>The decade 2012-2022 represents the largest decrease in prison population size since the practice of mass 
            incarceration became the norm in the United States around the 1980s. Between 1950 and 1980 there were
             relatively stable prison populations with around 160,000-200,000 people incarcerated in state and 
             federal prisons. By comparison in 1979 this number surpassed 300,000 for the first time and began to 
             skyrocket, already doubling by 1988, and hitting its peak in 2009 with over 1.5 million people held in 
             prison. </p>
        <p>Despite moderate declines since 2009, the most significant drop in prison population size was between 
            2019-2020, specifically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the sheer number of people 
            in a single prison overcrowding is a serious issue, and one exacerbated by COVID-19. According to the 
            <a href="https://eji.org/news/covid-19s-impact-on-people-in-prison/">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, this issue combined with the other unique health challenges of being incarcerated 
            and limited access to quality healthcare, resulted in incarcerated individuals being infected with covid at 
            a rate more than 5x the national rate. In order to attempt to mitigate these effects many inmates were 
            released from prison across the United States. This was only a temporary solution and the prison population 
            in 2022 has once again risen in an attempt to return to pre pandemic levels. </p>

        <p>The raw number of prisoners held in federal and state prisons, while informative for examining the scale of 
            the issue, lacks the nuance of regional differences in imprisonment practices. To note, the rate of
             imprisonment in these maps includes minors held in state and federal prisons. Historically Southern 
             States have had higher rates of imprisonment per 100,000 residents, while New England has had some of 
             the lowest rates. In 2012 Louisiana had the highest imprisonment rate with 870/100,000 residents. This 
             decreased significantly over the next decade with the rate of imprisonment being 596/100,000 residents in 
             2022. In 2022 Mississippi became the state with the largest rate of imprisonment with 661/100,000 residents. 
             Between 2012-2022 the National Average rate of imprisonment dropped from 480 to 355 prisoners per 100,000 residents. </p>

        <p>Not only has Louisiana had a history of being the state with the largest rate of imprisonment, it is also 
            home to the largest prison in the United States, Louisiana State Penitentiary (shown in the images above).
             Nicknamed Angola for the old plantation on which the prison now sits, the Louisiana State Penitentiary 
             covers 18,000 acres of land and houses more than 6,000 prisoners. Most of the prisoners in Angola are 
             serving life without the possibility of parole within. Along with most inmates serving life sentences, 
             over 70% of Angola’s prisoners are Black. </p>
        <p>Similar to the discussion of regional differences in imprisonment practices, it is impossible to discuss 
            imprisonment in the United States without addressing the racial differences in the system. People of 
            color–Black, Native American, and Hispanic–are imprisoned at rates significantly higher than other racial 
            groups. With the decade of change between 2012-2022 Black imprisonment went down by over 450 people per 100k 
            residents, representing the largest decrease in imprisonment rates. </p>

        <h2>About this story</h2>
        <p>
            This narrative was created as a final for DATA 1500, a Brown University course taught by 
            Professor Reuben Fischer-Baum. I first became interested in examining and addressing the issues of mass incarceration in high school when 
            I wrote my first large research paper on the adverse effects of solitary confinement on inmates in prison. 
            Since then I have taken numerous classes across my years in college expanding on this understanding. 
            This project represents an overview of the issue meant to introduce viewers to the issue of mass 
            incarceration in the United States, in the hopes that they will be motivated to go and explore the issue 
            on a deeper level. When pulling data for this project it came primarily from two sources: the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/list?series_filter=Prisoners">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, and the 
            <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/">Prison Policy Institute</a>. Within the data provided by the Bureau of Justice
            Statistics, the largest issue I found was that in 2012 Nevada and Illinois did not report their 
            imprisonment rate and as such I needed to gather that information separately from the other states' data.</p>
