        <p>Criminal justice is an issue which every country struggles to address. The system utilized in the United 
            States has resulted in some of the highest incarceration rates in the world. This system, often referred 
            to as mass incarceration, refers to the substantial increase in the number of people imprisoned as a result 
            of punitive criminal justice policies that disproportionately impact marginalized communities. This 
            narrative draws on data from the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/">Prison Police Institute</a> 
            to show racial and state-level comparisons to illustrate the scale of this crisis. </p>
        <p>The decade 2012-2022 represents the largest decrease in the number of people in prison since the practice of 
            mass incarceration became the norm in the United States around the 1980s. Between 1950 and 1980 there were 
            relatively stable prison populations with around ___ - ____ people incarcerated in state and federal prisons.
             By comparison in 1980 this number began to skyrocket, already doubling by ___, and hitting its peak in ____ 
             with over 1.5 million people held in prison. </p>
        <p>The most significant drop in prison population size was between 2019-2020, specifically as a result of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic resulted in many </p>

        <p>The raw number of prisoners held in federal and state prisons, while informative when examining the scale of
             this issue, lacks the nuance of regional differences in imprisonment practices. The rate of imprisonment 
             in these maps include minors held in state and federal prisons. Historically southern states have had 
             higher rates of imprisonment per 100,000 residents, while New England has some of the lowest rates. In 
             2012 Louisiana had the highest imprisonment rate with ___/100,000 residents. This decreased significantly 
             with the rate of imprisonment being ___/100,000 residents in 2022. In 2022 Mississippi was the state with 
             the largest rate of imprisonment with ___/100,000 residents. Between 2012-2022 the National Average rate 
             of imprisonment dropped from 480 to 355 prisoners per 100,000 residents.</p>

        <p>Along with regional differences in imprisonment practices it is impossible to discuss imprisonment in the 
            United States without addressing the racial differences in the system. People of color–Black, Native 
            American, and Hispanic–are imprisoned at rates significantly higher than other racial groups. With the 
            decade of change between 2012-2022 Black imprisonment went down by over 450 people per 100k residents, 
            representing the largest decrease in imprisonment rates. </p>

        <h2>About this story</h2>
        <p>I first became interested in examining and addressing the issues of mass incarceration in high school when 
            I wrote my first large research paper on the adverse effects of solitary confinement on inmates in prison. 
            Since then I have taken numerous classes across my years in college expanding on this understanding. 
            This project represents an overview of the issue meant to introduce viewers to the issue of mass 
            incarceration in the United States, in the hopes that they will be motivated to go and explore the issue 
            on a deeper level. When pulling data for this project it came primarily from two sources: the Bureau of 
            Justice Statistics and the Prison Policy Initiative. Within the data provided by the Bureau of Justice '
            Statistics, the largest issue I found was that in 2012 Nevada and Illinois did not report their 
            imprisonment rate and as such I needed to gather that information separately from the other states' data.</p>
