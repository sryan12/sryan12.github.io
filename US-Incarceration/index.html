        <p>The decade 2012-2022 represented the largest decrease in the number of people in prison since the practice 
            of mass incarceration became the norm in the United States around the 1980s. Between 1950 and 1980 there 
            were relatively stable prison populations with around ___ - ____ people incarcerated in state and federal 
            prisons. By comparison in 1980 this number began to skyrocket, already doubling by ___, and hitting its 
            peak in ____ with over 1.5 million people held in prison, ____.</p>
        <p>The raw number of prisoners held in federal and state prisons, while informative when examining the scale 
            of this issue, lacks the nuance of regional differences in imprisonment practices. Historically southern 
            states have had higher rates of imprisonment per 100 thousand residents. In 2012 Louisiana had the highest 
            imprisonment rate with ___/100 thousand residents. This decreased significantly with the rate of 
            imprisonment being ___/100 thousand residents in 2022.</p>

        <h2>About this story</h2>
        <p>I first became interested in examining and addressing the issues of mass incarceration in High School when I wrote my first large research paper on the adverse effects of solitary confinement on inmates in prison. Since then I have taken numerous classes across my years in college expanding on this understanding. This project represents an overview of the issue meant to introduce viewers to the issue of mass incarceration in the United States, in the hopes that they will be motivated to go and explore the issue on a deeper level. When pulling data for this project it came primarily from two sources: the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Prison Policy Initiative. Within the data provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the largest issue I found was that in 2012 Nevada and Illinois did not report their imprisonment rate and as such I needed to gather that information separately from the other states' data.</p>
